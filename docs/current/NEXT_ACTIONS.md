# Next Actions

This is the current prioritized action list. It must agree with
[`../PROJECT_MAP.md`](../PROJECT_MAP.md), [`RESUME_HERE.md`](RESUME_HERE.md),
[`WORK_STATUS.md`](WORK_STATUS.md), and [`../BASELINE_STATUS.md`](../BASELINE_STATUS.md).

## P0 - Current Task

**post-Phase-G module-envelope interpretation.**

Inputs:

- Phase G collection:
  `results/apt_serve_phase_g_resume_20260807_174028/`
- Preserved failed SS15 run:
  `results/apt_serve_phase_g_overnight_20260807_011542/`
- Canonical Phase G analysis:
  `results/apt_serve_phase_g_analysis_20260809_190000/`
- Audit:
  [`../audits/apt_serve_phase_g_analysis_20260809.md`](../audits/apt_serve_phase_g_analysis_20260809.md)

Deliverable:

- Decide which Apt-Serve cache/tier-transition mechanisms are candidates for
  typed module decomposition.
- Decide whether those mechanisms should enter a library-envelope evaluation
  tool as module candidates.
- Define the next WS-H/WS-K experiment without launching another broad
  Apt-Serve sweep.

## P0 (Policy Separation thread, independent of the above)

**Design and execute Policy Separation Fairness and Starvation Pilot (Family A).**

Inputs:

- Completed Sobol Pilot v1: Slurm Job `1182183`
- Audit: [`../audits/policy_separation_sobol_pilot_v1_20260816.md`](../audits/policy_separation_sobol_pilot_v1_20260816.md)

Status: Sobol Pilot v1 is complete, analyzed, and documented. Crossover boundaries on prediction inversion are successfully mapped, and Scorpio's structural dominance under overload is confirmed.

Deliverable for Next Step:

- Draft the design and configuration for **Family A (Fairness, Weight Skew, and Aging Starvation)** over 640 scenarios and 2,560 evaluations.
- Do not proceed to MAP-Elites or CMA-ES search yet; we must introduce the Fairness-vs-Throughput multi-tenant trade-off to justify Quality-Diversity.

## P1 - Library-Envelope Tooling

Build a standing evaluator for:

- existing-policy marginal contribution `MC_i(x; P)`;
- candidate marginal gain `MG_c(x; P)`;
- grouped bootstrap CIs by regime/context family;
- clear win/tie/loss classification at practical epsilon thresholds.

This should generalize the Phase G analysis pattern beyond Apt-Serve.

## P2 - Module Decomposition

Select one or two mechanisms from the completed external-baseline work and map
them into the typed DSL/module vocabulary. Apt-Serve's tier-transition behavior
is now a candidate input, but it is not the only candidate; Sarathi, VTC,
Llumnix, and DistServe mechanisms should stay visible.

## P3 - CC6 Decision

Only after P0-P2, decide whether CC6 dynamic adaptation should start. If it
starts, keep it restricted to the previously trusted CC5 operating envelope and
retain safe fallback outside that envelope.

## Stop Conditions

- Do not claim Phase G proves global Apt-Serve superiority.
- Do not rerun Phase G collection unless a concrete missing/invalid cell is
  discovered.
- Do not delete Phase G artifacts.
- Do not convert Apt-Serve into the whole project narrative.
- Do not start broad symbolic synthesis until module contribution evidence is
  stronger.
