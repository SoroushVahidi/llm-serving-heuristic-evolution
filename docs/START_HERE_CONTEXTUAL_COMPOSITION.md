# Start Here: Contextual Composition

Authoritative branch: `contextual-compositional-heuristics-20260731`

Current phase: `CC2 - Canonical primitive interface`

Pause state: intentionally paused after CC1b and before CC2 implementation.

Exact resume task after the pause: define the canonical primitive interface for
ranking, admission, placement, batching, and resource guards, then add
representative-policy equivalence tests. Do not extend the DSL yet. Use the
CC1b evidence in the
[Query 5 discriminativeness review](audits/contextual_composition_query5_discriminativeness_review_20260731.md).

## What Not To Do Yet

Do not implement broad heuristic primitives, policy-composition refactors, DSL
extensions, contextual predictors, dynamic adaptation, real-vLLM jobs, hosted
API experiments, or large simulator sweeps before the roadmap phase gate allows
them.

## How To Update Status

Every future implementation query must:

- verify branch and upstream;
- read the roadmap;
- identify the current `NEXT` phase;
- update roadmap status, evidence links, decisions, risks, and next action;
- add or update an audit report;
- run relevant tests;
- commit and push;
- leave the branch clean and synchronized.

Run the consistency checker before committing:

```bash
python scripts/check_contextual_composition_status.py
python scripts/check_contextual_composition_status.py --resume-readiness
```

## Historical Status And Safe Claims

Historical project status lives in `docs/current/` and the full historical index
is `docs/README.md`. Those documents remain provenance but may describe older
branches or phases.

Safe claim guidance lives in `docs/result_claims.md`. Contextual-composition
claims must distinguish historical simulator claims, corrected-objective claims,
real-trace-derived claims, hosted-API claims, and real-vLLM claims.
