# Start Here: Contextual Composition

Authoritative branch: `contextual-compositional-heuristics-20260731`

Current phase: `CC5 - Contextual composition predictor`

Pause state: none. CC4 is COMPLETE; CC5 is `NEXT` (queued, not started).

CC4 built the first reproducible, resumable, simulator-derived oracle
composition dataset (`src/llmserveopt/experiments/cc4_oracle_composition_dataset.py`,
`configs/cc4_oracle_composition_dataset.yaml`): 12 workload windows across
all required regime categories, 34 verified DSL/fixed candidates (0
rejected), 408 true simulator executions, 0 GPU/live-API/real-vLLM. A
composition-family candidate is the oracle winner on 66.7% of held-out
evaluation windows; completion-fraction constraints hold on every window.
20 new focused tests pass, including a real (non-mocked) resume/reproducibility
integration test. See
[CC4 oracle dataset report](audits/contextual_composition_cc4_oracle_dataset_report_20260803.md).

CC3 extended the JSON DSL/verifier (`src/llmserveopt/heuristics/`) to expose
named references to the CC2 primitive registry: weighted sums, sparse top-k
mixtures, conditional branches, admission gates with declared fallback,
placement-score composition, and externally supplied bounded parameters,
via a new read-only adapter module (`heuristics/primitive_bridge.py`). All
447 focused+regression tests pass and every pre-CC3 example and
genome-derived heuristic remains backward compatible. See the
[architecture doc](architecture/contextual_composition_dsl.md) and the
[CC3 DSL/verifier report](audits/contextual_composition_cc3_dsl_verifier_report_20260803.md).

CC2 implemented the canonical primitive interface
(`src/llmserveopt/policies/primitives.py`, 28 registered primitives across
RANKING/ADMISSION/PLACEMENT/BATCHING/RESOURCE_GUARD) and reconstructed
seven representative policies from it
(`src/llmserveopt/policies/primitive_reconstructions.py`), with 107 new
equivalence/registry tests. Six of seven reconstructions are EXACT; one
(`scorpio_style_slo_guard`) is documented APPROXIMATE. See the
[architecture doc](architecture/contextual_composition_primitives.md) and the
[CC2 primitive interface report](audits/contextual_composition_cc2_primitive_interface_report_20260802.md).

Exact next task: CC5 (contextual composition predictor training) has
**not** been started. A future, explicitly authorized query should begin it
by reading the CC4 oracle dataset report (its "Exact CC5 Entry Condition"
section) first, then training against `oracle_labels.parquet`/
`regret_matrix.parquet`/`causal_features.parquet`, fitting only on
`development_splits` windows and reserving `evaluation_splits` windows
exclusively for the reported validation claim. Do not begin CC6 dynamic
adaptation.

## What Not To Do Yet

CC2's primitive interface, representative-policy reconstructions, CC3's
compositional DSL/verifier extension, and CC4's oracle composition dataset
are all complete. Do not begin CC5 contextual predictor training without a
separate, explicitly authorized query, and do not begin dynamic adaptation
(CC6), counterexample hardening (CC7), real-vLLM jobs, hosted API
experiments, or large simulator sweeps before the roadmap phase gate allows
them.

## How To Update Status

Every future implementation query must:

- verify branch and upstream;
- read the roadmap;
- identify the current `NEXT` phase;
- update roadmap status, evidence links, decisions, risks, and next action;
- add or update an audit report;
- run relevant tests;
- commit and push;
- leave the branch clean and synchronized.

Run the consistency checker before committing:

```bash
python scripts/check_contextual_composition_status.py
python scripts/check_contextual_composition_status.py --resume-readiness
```

## Historical Status And Safe Claims

Historical project status lives in `docs/current/` and the full historical index
is `docs/README.md`. Those documents remain provenance but may describe older
branches or phases.

Safe claim guidance lives in `docs/result_claims.md`. Contextual-composition
claims must distinguish historical simulator claims, corrected-objective claims,
real-trace-derived claims, hosted-API claims, and real-vLLM claims.
